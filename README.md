# About Me :wave:

Hi there! I'm Albert Shen, a passionate full-stack software developer and UIUC CS graduate with 5+ years of experience building a variety of front-end and back-end applications both professionally and for personal projects. I started my journey in coding when I was 10 making programs in Visual Basic(shoutout to thenewboston).

I am currently working on dailyblocks, a mobile time blocking app with ~1K downloads on the iOS store, using React Native/JS. Subscribe to my newsletter on our [website](dailyblocks.app) for more info on future updates on the app.
